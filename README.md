## Git Conventions
The goal is to keep the revision history as clean as possible.

- Commits linked to an issue should start with the issue number: `#31: Add return button to homepage`
- Commits not linked to an issue should be very small and should be prefixed by `Fix:`. For example: `Fix: Correct small typo 'abuot us' in navbar`
- Branches should be associated with an issue and the issue number should be contained in the branch name. Ideally, you let Github create the branch automatically. 
- Branches should be merged into the main branch through a pull request (PR). The pull request should be merged using the 'Squash and Merge' option.
- Commits should be atomic. They should change or add exactly one thing to the codebase. Squash your commits if needed to achieve this.
